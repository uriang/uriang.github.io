Android 11 and the Ram increase will allow you to play and download different apps from the Play Store. <p>The <b>Retroid</b> <b>Pocket</b> <b>3</b> is an excellent, inexpensive retro gaming handheld, but it's not for users looking for an easy time. Android remains a somewhat more frustrating platform than Windows for. The <b>Retroid</b> <b>Pocket</b> 3+ is here, and it's an impressive upgrade from their previous models. In fact, it's kind of crazy considering the leaps and bounds that you'll find in this mere $20. <img src ="https://images.saymedia-content.com/.image/c_limit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:eco%2Cw_700/MTkxNzUwNTM1ODY5NjM4MTMw/retroid-pocket-3-review-should-you-buy-it.jpg" style="width:100%;text-align:center;" onerror="this.onerror=null;this.src='https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.GXnsGWK4yJBONaSw1RRRYgHaHa';"><br><h3>Retroid Pocket 3 Review  Should You Buy It  LevelSkip</h3><p>In terms of specs the new <b>Retroid</b> <b>Pocket</b> <b>3</b> is nearly identical to the 2+ and uses a Unisoc T310 Processor and 2GB's of RAM which can be upgraded to 3GBs for an extra 10 buckaroonies (which i highly recommend). This will give you a small power bump, but nothing too noticeable. How does the <b>Retroid</b> <b>Pocket</b> <b>3</b> Look & Feel?
